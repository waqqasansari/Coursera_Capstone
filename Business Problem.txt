In this project, we will try to find an optimal location for a restaurant. 
Specifically, this report will be targeted to stakeholders interested in opening a South Indian in New Delhi, India.
Since there are lots of restaurants in New Delhi we will try to detect locations that are not already crowded with restaurants. 
We are also particularly interested in areas with no South Indian in the vicinity. 
We would also prefer locations as close to the city center as possible, assuming that the first two conditions are met.
We will use our data science powers to generate a few most promising neighborhoods based on these criteria. 
The Advantages of each area will then be clearly expressed so that the best possible final location can be chosen by stakeholders.
