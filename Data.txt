Based on the definition of our problem, the factors that will influence our decision are:
number of existing restaurants in the neighborhood (any type of restaurant)
number of and distance to South Indian restaurants in the neighborhood, if any
The distance of the neighborhood from the city center
We decided to use regularly spaced grid of locations, centered around city center, to define our neighborhoods.
For this project, we will use Kaggle Zomato dataset(https://https://www.kaggle.com/shrutimehta/zomato-restaurants-data). 
This data set contains the required information. And we will use this data set to explore various locality of new Delhi city.
number of restaurants and their type and location in every neighborhood will be obtained using Foursquare API
